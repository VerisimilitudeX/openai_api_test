The extra credit can affect your grade by potentially pushing you up to the next grade point if you are very close (e.g. 3.0 to 3.1). They are meant to be fun extensions rather than required parts of the course. Our advice is to complete extra credit for your own learning or review, but it is unlikely to be an efficient use of your time if you are completing it solely to boost your grade.\n",

So for example, if a problem asks you to compute the average age of people in a dataset, you should be writing Python code in this notebook to do the computation instead of plugging it into some calculator and saving the hard-coded answer in the variable. In other words, we should be able to run your code on a smaller/larger dataset and get correct answers for those datasets with your code.\n",
