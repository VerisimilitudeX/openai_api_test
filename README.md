# University of Washington CSE 416: Introduction to Machine Learning

This project analyzes protein quantity measurements from brain tissue samples across multiple regions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install the required packages:
3. Place your 'ProteinAndPathologyQuantifications.csv' file in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to perform the following steps:

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Pre-processing (imputation and normalization)
3. PCA
4. Visualization of results (scatter plots, heatmap, biplot)

## Output

The script generates the following plots:
- PCA scatter plots
- Cumulative explained variance plot
- PCA loadings heatmap
- Biplot
-
